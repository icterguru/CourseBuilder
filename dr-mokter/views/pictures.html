					<b>Mokter Hossain </b>has been pursuing second PhD in Computer Science at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, USA since Fall 2012. He received first PhD in Curriculum, Teaching, and Learning, with an emphasis on Information Technology in Teaching-Learning Mathematics, from the University of Nevada, Reno, USA in Spring 2012. He have more than sixteen years of teaching experience in undergraduate and graduate levels; published more than twenty research papers in international peer-reviewed journals and conferences; and authored about twenty books on Computers, Computer Programming, and Information and Communication Technology in Education and Research. </p>
					<p> As a Graduate Research Assistant, <b>Dr. Hossain </b>has been working on the NSF CE21 Project that has been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). The project is aimed to develop and evaluate a model for the scalable deployment and sustainable persistence of the new Computer Science Principles course across the statewide network of teachers. It will provide year-long professional development to support teachers, rather than the week-long summer institutes that are typical of most AP training programs in other STEM areas.
